# yelp-review-recommendation

When looking at a business on Yelp, users may be interested in seeing what other users had to say about said business. They can sort these reviews based on star-ratings, "hotness", Yelp-elite status or recency. However, these sorting methods give no guarantee that the user will find a review that is most relevant to them. Using a combination of network-based approaches such as breadth-first search and eigenvector centrality, we determined rankings for Yelp business reviews based on individual user preference.

The performance of our model was measured using the root mean square error (RMSE) of review-rating prediction compared to a baseline of RMSE for average business rating. For more information, see the "presentation.pptx" and "report.pdf" files.
